# barcodes
Collapsing barcodes generated by faulty dropseq beads.
Implemented in Python.

## Scripts
* `deletionsAnalysis`, collapses barcodes according to existence
of Ts in the end of UMIs. Assumes the existence of a single tab 
separated file containing each barcode and its UMI.
* `checkHamming`, collapses barcodes from bulk onto top ones.
Only mutations are currently considered. Assumes the existence of 
two files, `topBarcodes.txt` and `restBarcodes.txt`, which are lists 
of barcodes sorted by number of reads.

## To-do list
### High priority
* collapse a set of top barcodes among themselves.

### Medium priority
* introduce dynamically thresholds for number of reads and/or 
percentages of Ts.
* introduce check for percentage of Gs in the last positions
of barcodes when Ts are found in the UMIs.
* introduce computeKnee function to have an estimate of the number
of tops.

### Low priority
* refactor the `deletionsAnalysis` search to incorporate arbitrary
number of bases to check.
* improve the structure of identifying mutations function in the 
`checkHamming`.
* possibly trear Ns in the `checkHamming`.
